## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the ChronoFlow app up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    The application uses Genkit for AI features, which typically requires API keys for services like Google AI (Gemini).
    *   Create a `.env` file in the root of your project.
    *   Add your API keys and any other necessary environment variables. For example:
        ```env
        GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY
        # Add other variables as needed
        ```
    *   The `src/ai/genkit.ts` file is configured to use these variables.

4.  **Run the Development Server:**
    To start the Next.js development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Or using yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

5.  **Run the Genkit Development Server (for AI features):**
    For the Smart Scheduler and other AI functionalities to work, you need to run the Genkit development server in a separate terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    Or using yarn (if you prefer to have it watch for changes):
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```
    This will start the Genkit server, typically on port `4000` or another available port if `4000` is in use.

### Building for Production

To build the application for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn build
```
Then, to start the production server:
```bash
npm run start
```
Or using yarn:
```bash
yarn start
```
